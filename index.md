## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3, Part 1
One of the labs I enjoyed was Lab 3, Part 1, which focused on calculating a male's and a female’s BMR. I enjoyed creating this because the program can be used for personal use or by those into fitness. Additionally, I learned the importance of when to use integers and doubles as a new coder.
​
Lab 4, Part 2
My next favorite lab was Lab 4, Part 2, because this was the first time working with if statements. I enjoyed working in this lab because if statements allow for many possibilities within a program, as one can add an if statement inside of another if statement to fit certain conditions.
​
Lab 6, Part 2
Lastly, my last favorite lab was Lab 6, Part 2, which is when we created a blackjack game. Not only was this just a fun program to make, but I also learned how to use Boolean expressions, and this program may also help someone who does not know how to play blackjack learn the game. And it was overall a great experience.
